# Final Project Retrospective

## Team Members
- Student 1: General Malit
- Student 2: Romielle Pajaron

## 1. How did you divide the work between you and your partner?
_Romielle focused on implementing Features 1 and 2, while General took charge of Features 3 and 4. Initially, we worked independently on our assigned features. Subsequently, we engaged in collaborative discussions to align on core design principles, particularly concerning logic flow and coding practices, to ensure consistency across all integrated features._

## 2. What Git strategies or commands helped you most during the project?
_Frequent commits with descriptive messages were crucial for tracking progress and providing clear checkpoints. We utilized separate feature branches (git checkout -b feature-branch-name) for individual development, which allowed us to work in isolation without disrupting the main codebase. Regular git pull origin main commands kept our local branches up-to-date with the latest changes from the main repository. Finally, git merge was used to integrate completed features back into the main branch._

## 3. Describe a merge conflict you encountered. What caused it and how did you resolve it?
_A conflict happened in main.pseudo and store_view.pseudo because it was initially built for Features 3 & 4. When Features 1 & 2 (with overlapping changes) were merged, it caused problems. We resolved it by discussing and clarifying the application design, then manually combining the logic from both sets of features in main.py._

## 4. What were the biggest challenges you faced as a team?
_Communicating and aligning on design decisions as we developed features separately was tough. Making sure our code was easy to understand and integrate was hard. This showed us the need for good documentation and consistent communication._

## 5. What did you learn about using Git in a collaborative setting?
_Git showed us the importance of clear communication and a good branching strategy. Small, frequent commits make it easier to fix issues. Regular git pull keeps you synced. Knowing how to resolve merge conflicts is essential for smooth collaboration._

## 6. How would you improve your workflow next time?
_Next time, we'd do more frequent code reviews to catch integration problems earlier (or have them not occur at all). We'd break down tasks more clearly beforehand (maybe using a task board). We'd also define connections between features to avoid surprises._

## 7. Optional: Any feedback on the activity?
_The activity was a really good simulation of real-world Git collaboration._
